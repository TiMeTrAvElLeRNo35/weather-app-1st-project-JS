Great! Let’s break down your CSS so you understand exactly what it does and how it affects your weather app. I’ll also explain what your page would look like with these styles. 😊  

---

## **1. Global Reset (`*{}` selector)**
```css
*{
    margin: 0;
    padding: 0;
    font-family: 'Poppins', sans-serif;
    box-sizing: border-box;
}
```
### **What it does?**
- `margin: 0;` → Removes all default margin (space outside elements).
- `padding: 0;` → Removes default padding (space inside elements).
- `font-family: 'Poppins', sans-serif;` → Sets the font for the entire webpage.
- `box-sizing: border-box;` → Ensures padding and border don’t increase element size.

### **Impact on the app**
This makes sure that your elements start from the very edges of the page without unexpected spacing. It also makes sure the layout behaves as expected.

## **2. Body Background Styling**
```css
body{
    background: #222;
}
```
### **What it does?**
- `background: #222;` → Sets the background color of the whole page to a dark gray.

### **Impact on the app**
Your webpage will have a **dark gray background**, giving it a sleek and modern look.

---

## **3. Weather Card Styling**
```css
.card{
    width: 90%;
    max-width: 470px;
    background: linear-gradient(135deg, #00feba, #5b548a);
    color:#fff;
    margin: 100px auto 0;
    border-radius: 20px;
    padding: 40px 35px;
    text-align: center;
}
```
### **What it does?**
- `width: 90%;` → The card takes 90% of the screen width on small screens.
- `max-width: 470px;` → The card won't go wider than **470 pixels** (good for responsiveness).
- `background: linear-gradient(135deg, #00feba, #5b548a);` → Applies a gradient from **cyan (#00feba)** to **purple (#5b548a)**.
- `color: #fff;` → Text color inside the card is **white**.
- `margin: 100px auto 0;` → 
  - `100px` from the top (pushes the card down).
  - `auto` centers the card horizontally.
- `border-radius: 20px;` → **Rounded corners** (20px curve).
- `padding: 40px 35px;` → Adds **space inside** the card so content isn’t too close to the edges.
- `text-align: center;` → Centers the text inside the card.

### **Impact on the app**
- Your weather card will appear **centered** on the screen.
- It will have a **gradient background** (cyan to purple).
- The card will have **rounded corners** and look modern.
- Text inside the card will be **white** and **centered**.

### **Example Visualization**
If we apply this CSS to your HTML, your weather card will look something like this:

🌫️ **Imagine a dark gray background**   
📦 **A centered box (card) with a blue-purple gradient**  
📝 **White text inside the box**

### **What’s Next?**
Now that you understand the styles, the next step is:
✅ Adding styles for the **input box** and **search button**  
✅ Improving the layout for weather info
